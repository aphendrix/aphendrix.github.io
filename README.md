## About Me
### My interests
 * **Sports** - I have loved sports my entire life and have played most of them either recreationally, or in an organized setting. My favorite sport is _basketball_, but I haven't discovered a sport that I don't enjoy to some extent. A sport that I recently have come to thoroughly enjoy is _golf_.
 * **Sneakers** - I have enjoyed buying, collecting, and customizing sneakers for most of my life. This passion took off when I started playing basketball in middle school.
 * **Traveling** - I grew up going on various trips with friends and family and made so many fond memories. I hope to be able to travel to many more destinations in my lifetime with my own family.
## Websites
* [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/) - This is where I get most of my sports _news_, _scores_, and _information_. I'm always trying to be updated on the latest happenings in the sports world and this is the best website to get it from.
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - From endless entertaining content to extremely helpful guides and tutorials, YouTube has a myriad of videos on their website that any individual can find beneficial.
